# 🛡️ Raj's Cybersecurity Tools & Labs

This repository is a collection of personal tools, scripts, and learning resources I've created while studying and practicing cybersecurity — with a focus on detection, incident response, and OT/ICS security.

## 🔍 Detection Scripts
- `ssh_log_monitor.py`: Detects brute-force attempts in Linux SSH logs.

## 🧪 Simulated OT Labs
- `conpot_setup_guide.md`: Step-by-step setup for running an ICS honeypot.

## 📚 Threat Analysis Writeups
- `stuxnet_summary.md`: Beginner-friendly breakdown of the Stuxnet cyberweapon.

## ⚙️ Other Tools
- `ics_log_analyzer.py`: Parses ICS-style logs and flags suspicious commands.
